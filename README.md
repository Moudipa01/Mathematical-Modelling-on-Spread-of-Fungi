# Mathematical-Modelling-on-Spread-of-Fungi

## Description:

This model takes in account of factors like the existing population of fungus, its
lifespan, the minimum moisture requirement and if the fungus has sufficient food
or not. This model is able to mimic the real-world scenario in terms of population
variation of fungus. It also shows how everything falls into a stable equilibrium
even after periodic changes in moisture levels. Initially I have developed the
model in terms of a system of a DE with the food source and one specie of fungus
in play. Once the system started to make sense, we extended it for multiple species.
It is very interesting to see how different species with different growth rates,
moisture tolerance and lifespans grow alongside one another. Our model is heavily
relied on Eulers Method of analyzing DEs using MATLAB. Also, this model
neglects one very important part of the fungus that is its hyphae for which we have
also tried to develop a different set of DE.
