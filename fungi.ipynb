    "Nutrition:\n",
    "Fungi get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from the environment. Fungi\n",
    "are heterotrophic: they rely solely on carbon obtained from other organisms for their\n",
    "metabolism and nutrition. Fungi have evolved in a way that allows many of them to use a large\n",
    "variety of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as nitrate, ammonia,\n",
    "acetate, or ethanol. Their mode of nutrition defines the role of fungi in their environment.\n",
    "On the basis of mode of nutrition, fungi are classified into four groups:\n",
    "(1) Saprophytes: These fungi obtain nutrition from dead organic matter. Ex.- Mucor,Rhizopus\n",
    "(2) Parasites: Parasites Parasites fungi take food from other living plants or animals. The living\n",
    "organisms on which they parasite are called host. Ex.- Puccinia\n",
    "(3) Symbionts: These fungi grow on or with another living organism but both of them are\n",
    "mutually benefited. Lichens and mycorrhiza are the best example of symbionts.\n",
    "➢ Lichens are the symbiotic association between algae and fungi. Here both fungi and\n",
    "algae are mutually benefited. Algae synthesize carbohydrates whereas the fungi provides\n",
    "shelter for algae.\n",
    "➢ Mycorrhiza are the symbiotic association between fungi and roots of some higher plants.\n",
    "It helps in the absorption of nutrients by the host plant.\n",
    "(4) Predacious: They are animal capturing fungi. They usually inhabit in the soil. Ex: -\n",
    "Arthrobotrys, Dactylella.\n",
    "Idle Environmental Conditions:\n",
    "They are mostly terrestrial. They prefer to grow in warm and humid places. They may grow in\n",
    "warm and humid places. They may grow on tree bark, dung, wood, burnt wood and keratinous\n",
    "material (e.g., hair, horns).\n",
    "• Temperature: 25- 30 degree Celsius.\n",
    "• Humidity: high moist humid environment.\n",
    "• pH: Moulds differ in their pH requirements. Most will grow well over the\n",
    "pH range 3-7. Some such as Aspergillus niger and Penicillium funiculus can\n",
    "grow at pH 2 and below.\n",
    "• Nutrients: Nutrient requirements for moulds may vary from mould to\n",
    "mould. Some moulds may thrive well on substrates with high sugar or salt\n",
    "content. Some may prefer simple sugars while others have the ability to\n",
    "utilize complex sugars.\n",
    "• Light: Many moulds species grow well in the dark, but some prefer daylight\n",
    "or alternate light and darkness for them to produce spores.\n",
    "• Aeration: Nearly all moulds require air to grow.\n",
    "Reproduction:\n",
    "Fungi reproduce by all the three modes i.e., vegetation, asexual and sexual.\n",
    "Vegetative Reproduction:\n",
    "It occurs by the following methods:\n",
    "• Fragmentation: The mycelium brakes up into two or more fragment due to mechanical\n",
    "injury, decay or some other reasons. Each fragment grows into independent mycelium.\n",
    "• Fission: Here, simple splitting of vegetative cells into two daughter cells takes place by\n",
    "simple constriction.\n",
    "• Budding: Some fungi like yeast produce small outgrowth, i.e., buds from their vegetative\n",
    "body. Eventually, the buds are cut off from parent cell and mature to from new induvial. \n",
    "Asexual Reproduction:\n",
    "It occurs through spores. These are single called specialized structures which separate from the\n",
    "organism, get dispersed and germinate to produce new mycelium after falling on suitable\n",
    "substrate. The spores produced during asexual reproduction in fungi are formed by miotic\n",
    "division and are thus termed, mitospores.\n",
    "The various kind of asexual reproduction are as follows:\n",
    "• Zoospore: Many fungi, especially aquatic members produce these types of spores. They\n",
    "germinate to give rise to new mycelium. Ex. Saprolegnia, Pythium.\n",
    "• Sporangiospore: Sporangiospores are thin-walled non-motile spores produced\n",
    "endogenously in a sporangium during favourite conditions, which after liberation give\n",
    "rise to new mycelium. Ex. - Rhizopus, Mucor.\n",
    "• Conidia: Conidia are non-motile, thin-walled exogenous spores produced at the tips of\n",
    "erect hyphae called conidiophore. They are arranged in chains upon the conidiospore Ex.\n",
    "Aspergillus and Penicillium\n",
    "• Chlamydospore: In some fungi the hyphae under unfavourable conditions, forms thickwalled resting resistant spores which later get separated from each other. They may\n",
    "remain viable for several years. On return to favourable conditions, they germinate to\n",
    "give rise to new individuals. Thus, chlamydospores are structures for perennation also,\n",
    "Ex.- Rhizopus.\n",
    "• Oidia: Non-motile thin-walled spores developing under rich conditions in medium. Their\n",
    "budding condition is called torula stage. \n",
    "Sexual reproduction:\n",
    "[1] During the process of sexual reproduction, a huge number of spores are produced from the\n",
    "parents’ body. The produced spores disperse either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an\n",
    "animal, as they are lighter and smaller than the seeds. The dispersed spores land in an\n",
    "environment that will support their growth.\n",
    "In fungi, sexual reproduction frequently takes place under unfavourable environmental\n",
    "conditions. Based on the mating types, they are classified into two types:\n",
    "1. Homothallic – When both mating types are present in the same mycelium. It is also called\n",
    "self-fertile.\n",
    "2. Heterothallic – When both mating types are present in two different mycelium.\n",
    "There are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction, which includes the following three\n",
    "stages.\n",
    "1. Plasmogamy: The fusion of protoplasm.\n",
    "2. Karyogamy: The fusion of nucleus.\n",
    "3. Meiosis: Cell cycle involved with the nuclear division.\n",
    "This sexual mode of reproduction in fungi is referred to as teleomorph and are of four types:\n",
    "1. Ascospores\n",
    "2. Basidiospores\n",
    "3. Oospores\n",
    "4. Zygospores"
